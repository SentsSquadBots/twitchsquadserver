# twitchsquadserver

This is a Twitch.tv chatbot which responds to !server in the chat and responds with the streamer's current Squad server along with server details such as queue and map.

Note: This was originally made to handle multiple twitch channels, but it will work for a single one. You need to have the .py file and the .cfg file in the same folder, then run the .py file using your commandline by navigating to the folder and running `python twitchsquadserverbot.py`
